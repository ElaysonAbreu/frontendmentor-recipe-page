        <h2>Ingrendients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
          <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Beat the eggs</strong>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are
            well
            mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
          <li><strong>Heat the pan</strong>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook the omelette</strong>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
            to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
          <li><strong>Add fillings (optional)</strong>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
            runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
          <li><strong>Fold and serve</strong>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
            over
            the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
          <li><strong>Enjoy</strong>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
        </ol>

  # Changelog

  ## v1.1
  - New directory: ‚Äúcss‚Äù.
  - Added `* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}` to the beginning of `style.css`.
  - New `<div>`‚Äôs with `id`‚Äôs ‚Äúbody‚Äù and ‚Äúinbody‚Äù.
  - In order to be compatible with my Responsive Viewer, the <body> element will not be styled. A `<div id="body">` will be used for this purpose.
  - The `<main>` element does not need to be configured. Its settings have been moved to `<html>` or `#body`.
  - The font size of the titles has been reset.
  - Lists have been reimplemented so that it is no longer necessary to insert negative measures in `<margin>` or `<padding>`. Additionally, the `list-style-position` attribute has been set to `outside` explicitly.

  ## v1.0
  - The width of <body> has been fixed to 720px; it was centralized; a `background-color` was added.
  - Landmark <main> added.
  - The edges of .prep-time and the omelet photo have been rounded.
  - The `width` attribute is no longer specified directly in the <img> tag. Instead, it is now declared in the .css file in the form `max-width: 100%`.
