## Overview

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Using `@font-face` to request fonts from your own directory is very convenient. It's better than installing them on the OS.

### Continued development

I still need to understand the influence of `border-collapse` on the configurations of a `<table>`.

### Useful resources

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-load-and-use-custom-fonts-with-css) - Here I was able to learn about the most varied ways of loading a font, especially with `@font-face`.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) - Using `<hr>` instead of a `<div class="hrule"></div>` is probably better.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29166036) - It is possible to center `<body>` using `margin: auto`.
